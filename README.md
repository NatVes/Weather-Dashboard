## Description

Welcome to the Weather Dashboard project! This web application is designed to provide users with a convenient way to check the weather outlook for multiple cities. The dashboard dynamically updates HTML and CSS to display current and future weather conditions. Users can also access a 5-day forecast for the selected city.

## Project Overview

Server APIs allow developers to access data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This Weather Dashboard leverages the OpenWeatherMap APIs to retrieve weather data for cities, presenting it in an easy-to-read format for users.

### Features

* User-friendly interface with form inputs for city searches.
* Display of current weather conditions, including city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
* 5-day forecast showcasing date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
* Search history functionality to quickly access weather details for previously searched cities.
